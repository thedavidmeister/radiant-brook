 * - Get the volume of BTC purchaseable for chosen USD price & volume
 * - Get the total USD amount, including fees

 * - Get the 5% percentile of asks as a USD price for BTC
 * - Get the USD amount to cover, including bid/ask fees and min USD profit
 * - Get the minimum total BTC volume to sell to cover USD amount, scaled to

 *
 * - If the USD amount spent in bid can be covered with min USD profit, and the
